## Scenario

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

The code in this repo should accomplish the following:

* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
